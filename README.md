## "Flaming Pizza" Demo Project (NextJS 15/Typescript/Tailwind 4)

### This is a demo project made for portfolio purposes.

The project demonstrates a pizza website using the following:

- NextJS 15
- Typescript
- Tailwind 4
- Server actions (useActionState)
- Zod (Validation)
- React Hot Toast
- Loadash

To run the project, please open a terminal and read the json data via JSON-Server:

`npx json-server ./data/db.json --port 3001 --host 127.0.0.1`

and `npm run dev` to view in a browser.

## Updates/improvements I intend to make in given time

Given time, there are a number of updates/improvements I would make:

- Add a database & read/write the data from there instead
- Add "Auth" forms (Login/Signup etc), read/write from a database and protect the "Create form" route if the user has not logged in
- Add an "Order form" journey

### Thank you
